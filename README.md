## How to debug this project
1. install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
2. `jekyll build` - Builds the site and outputs a static site to a directory called `_site`.
3. `jekyll serve` - Does the same thing except it rebuilds any time you make a change and runs a local web server at `http://localhost:4000`.
4. `jekyll clean` - Remove the `_sites` folder.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/OPIG/opig.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/OPIG/opig.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
