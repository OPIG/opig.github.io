# Jekyll
Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.

## install 安装

### Requirements
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) version 2.4.0 or above, including all development headers (ruby version can be checked by running `ruby -v`)
- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) (which you can check by running `gem -v`)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (in case your system doesn’t have them installed, which you can check by running `gcc -v`,`g++ -v` and `make -v` in your system’s command line interface)

### Jekyll on Windows
#### Installation via RubyInstaller
The easiest way to run Jekyll is by using the RubyInstaller for Windows.
1. Download and Install a `Ruby+Devkit` version from [RubyInstaller Downloads](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/). Use default options for installation.
2. Run the `ridk install` step on the last stage of the installation wizard. This is needed for installing gems with native extensions. You can find addtional information regarding this in the [RubyInstaller Documentation](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2#using-the-installer-on-a-target-system)
3. Open a new command prompt window from the start menu, so that changes to the `PATH` environment variable becomes effective. Install Jekyll and Bundler via: `gem install jekyll bundler`
4. Check if Jekyll installed properly: `jekyll -v`
That’s it, you’re ready to use Jekyll!



## Create a sitePermalink 创建网站

### folder directory
``` yml
+ root
    - index.html   //homepage
    - _config.yml  //global configuration
    + _posts       //articles
        - year-month-day-articleTitle.extention(md/txt/html...) //force limite file name format
    + _layouts     //template 
       - default.html   //template file
    + _include     //also like template, usually store some public pages here like header.html, footer.html
        - head.html
    + _data         //usually store some data like navigation item
        - fileName.yml(like navigation.yml)   //"site.data.fileName"(site.data.navigation) can get the file data, and you can use "for" read it.
    + assets        //store img, css, js
        + css
            - fileName.scss(like main.scss)    //this file import files in folder _sass. for example: @import "index". The pages can add link and href redirect to the /assets/css/main.css, then we can get the stylesheet in index.scss
    + _sass
        - fileName.scss(likce index.scss)
    + customerFolder
    + collectionFolder  //need config in _config.yml
    + _sites    //after build, all generated pages was stored here

```

### Build
1. `jekyll build` - Builds the site and outputs a static site to a directory called `_site`.

2. `jekyll serve` - Does the same thing except it rebuilds any time you make a change and runs a local web server at `http://localhost:4000`.
3. `jekyll clean` - Remove the `_sites` folder.

##  pagination 分页

include the jekyll-paginate plugin in your `_config.yml` under plugins. then install it, like `gem install jekyll-paginate`

```yml 
 plugins: [jekyll-paginate]  //plugin name. Also can write as: plugins: - jekyll-paginate

 paginate: 3   //item count on each page.

 paginate_path: "/blogs/page:num/"  /*files generate to folder "blogs" and the subfolder is page2,page3....page:num.
 Jekyll does not generate a ‘page1’ folder*/
 ```

### Pagination only works within HTML files

Pagination does not work from within Markdown files from your Jekyll site. Pagination works when called from within the HTML file,
named `index.html`, which optionally may reside in and produce pagination from within a subdirectory, via the  paginate_path configuration value.


### 在子页中添加分页功能: 

在根目录下新建一个文件夹blogs,在该文件夹中新建一个文件`index.html`(文件名固定，改为其他不能达到效果)，index.html文件中添加获取list的循环已经分页代码； `_config.yml`中设置 `paginate_path: "/blogs/page:num/"`，build之后对应的页面会生成在`_site\blogs`中：


```
|+ blogs
    |- index.html
    |+ page2
        |- index.html
    |+ page3
        |- index.html
        . 
        .
        .
    |+ page:num
        |- index.html
```


### noticed: Don't set a permalink

Setting a permalink in the front matter of your blog page(blogs/index.html) will cause pagination to break. Just omit the permalink.
